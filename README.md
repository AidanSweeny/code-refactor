# Code-Refactor

For this project we were assigned to edit a marketing company's webpage so that it was much more organized and followed the acceptance requirements provided for us. I went into this html file and editted some of the different elements, such as the semantic elements and the headings, so that they were in sequential order. There were also some issues with brackets that did not need closing brackets. In addition to this I added alt tags to all of the images such as the line below:
```
<img src="./assets/images/search-engine-optimization.jpg" class="float-left" alt = "SEO image with notepad and computer"/>
```
I also had to refactor the image on the main part of the webpage so that it was actually created in the html document and could have an alt tag. The image is shown below after the changes that I made:
<img class = "image" src = "./assets/images/screenshot.jpg" alt = "screenshot"/>

## Getting Started

To get this project running, one must copy the files from the class repository.

### Prerequisites

To have this project run, one must download VS Code off the appstore, and create a GitHub account. Git is also required to run this program, which can be downloaded 

```
$ brew install git. 
```
Homebrew can also be downloaded by inputting the following command in the terminal:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

### Installing

To install this project one must go through the GitHub website in order to clone this project. Clicking on the cone or download button and then copying the link that comes from that. One can then go into the Terminal application, and use the following command to copy the files:
`
git clone URL
`
This should then be moved to your desktop, or somewhere else on your computer. This will allow access to the html and css files. Opening the html file in a default browser will allow one to observe the website.
